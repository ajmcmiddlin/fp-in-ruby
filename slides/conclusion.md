# Wrapping up

## Take away

- Concepts from FP will give you more robust software
- Some ideas from FP are achievable in Ruby
    + Immutability (sometimes)
    + Higher order functions via blocks/`Proc`
    + Effects at the boundaries
- Ruby falls down with deeper abstractions
    + Against the design/intentions of the language
    + Lack of types/tool suppport
   
<div class="notes">
- Using what you can will make your code better
- You'll hit a limit fairly quickly
   + Ability to keep everything in your head starts to break down
   + This is where tools/types help
- Deeper abstraction _does_ matter
   + less repetition
   + less bugs
   + shared understanding and code
   + steal from mathematicians
- You don't know what you're missing out on until you have it

## What now?

##

Try these ideas on your Ruby

##

Homework: write tic-tac-toe using these principles

- Functional core, imperative shell
- Immutable data in the core
- Higher order functions
- Closed structs
